# Relay Links

This is just an example of [GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) React application based on [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

Queries, mutations and even subscriptions based on websockets are all here, so check it out! :sunglasses:

Unlike the [Apollo application](https://github.com/pengfluf/apollo-links), in this case the server is already configured remotely, so you don't need to start the local one.

## How to start
Install dependencies
``` bash
yarn install
```
OR
``` bash
npm install
```
Start the application at localhost:3000
``` bash
yarn start
```
OR
``` bash
npm start
```
